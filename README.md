# Yorùbá Language-Translation

In this project, I will be training a sequence to sequence model on dataset that contain English and Yoruba sentences that can translate new sentences from English to Yorùbá using the template provided by Udacity. I will apply neural network machine translation.

helper.py contains helper functions that were provided by Udacity.

problem_unittests.py also provided by Udacity.

*I am tweaking the codebase to build a sequence-to-sequence neural network, with TensorFlow, that can translate text from English to Yoruba Language.*

The easiest approach to view my current work is to look at the .ipynb file.


### According to Fagbolu et al, 2015, there is a need to design a graphical representation for electronic collection of Yorùbá words and also Evaluate the performance and usefulness of Yorùbá corpus. Due to the fact that there are series of difficulties in building Yorùbá corpus and also, translating the whole language of English to Yoruba will take lots of time to train. I am starting with a small portion of English to Yorùbá corpus which will be updated gradually with time. I will continue to load the dataset in order to better the system.


## Desired translation:

### input : 
**On the last day of school, she gave each student a gift-wrapped present.**

### output :
**Lọ́jọ́ tí kíláàsì àkọ́kọ́ parí gan-an, ó fún akẹ́kọ̀ọ́ kọ̀ọ̀kan ní ẹ̀bùn kan tó fi nǹkan wé.**
